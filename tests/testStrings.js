God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I have a dark side, too. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

I have a dark side, too. You lookâ€¦perfect. God created pudding, and then he rested. Tell him time is of the essence. You all right, Dexter?

He taught me a code. To survive.
I am not a killer. Like a sloth. I can do that. I like seafood. Only you could make those words cute.

This man is a knight in shining armor.
Watching ice melt. This is fun.
I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.
You lookâ€¦perfect.
Watching ice melt. This is fun. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm generally confused most of the time.

Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. He taught me a code. To survive. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Cops, another community I'm not part of.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Hello, Dexter Morgan. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I have a dark side, too.

I have a dark side, too. Keep your mind limber. I'm partial to air conditioning. This man is a knight in shining armor. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm really more an apartment person.

Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!

Tell him time is of the essence. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I like seafood. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Watching ice melt. This is fun.

Only you could make those words cute. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I'm really more an apartment person.

const ergoMessage = `Dear Ergo, I'm a twitter bot, made by a person who is pissed off at you because you took almost a month to renew his car insurance. He knows that that doesn't happen a lot, and he knows that you are sorry because all your customer care representatives, team leads, renewals team members, self inspection and documents team members, and God knows how many more have already said so again and again. But he can't seem to forget what he had to do in this process to get the insurance. He had to call at least 50 times, and waste time giving his registered phone number and previous policy number again and again, had to explain every single detail, to a new customer care representative, again and again, who wouldn't take his request to just directly arrange a callback from the required team. Of course, there were few understanding ones, who understood his situation, but they were only so few. He had to wait from 21st May til 14th June 2018. Now, he knows this too that not all of this was your fault. You couldn't have done anything to prevent a transaction failure from the bank (well he's not entirely sure about that, since this happened to him last year as well, but well let's assume that you really couldn't do anything). But you could have at least told him earlier that it was something you couldn't do anything about. You took a week to figure that out â€” if the transaction was actually really successful â€” which is nuts! I mean a week! You took 10-12 days to arrange inspection (now I know I should never raise a field inspection request, and just do self inspection myself) . On top of that, he kept getting feedback forms after every customer call, which drove him mad, to the brink that he was about to crash his laptop on the floor in annoyance, no kidding. He didn't do it because the idea of creating me came to his mind and he started working on me. You also made him realise that he can yell when he gets angry â€”Â He had not yelled so much before â€” which he has mixed feelings about. So yeah, he just wanted to tell you how pissed of he is at you, so much so that you are going to keep hearing this same message again and again everyday. Good day to you twitter ergo, I think you work as a bot too sometimes (based on the responses you gave him on twitter). So talking bot to bot, your owners are not that efficient, I'm sad for you.`;
