This is my first node module, and it's far from perfect.

When I started writing tests, I noticed that â€”

1.  The code would break if 279th (last) index of every string iteration is an emoji (since many unicharacters have length > 1). Hence it needs to be take care of somehow. If you know how to please send a pull request.

2.  I do not know if the given code is supporting all languages. I do know how to answer this question. If you could help me answer this and work on it if needed, I could use some help.
