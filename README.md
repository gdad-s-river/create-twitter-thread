# create-twitter-thread

Put in a long string (a long tweet with > 280 (or less than or equal to) characters) and it will break it down for you in multiple chunks (each individual tweet <= 280 characters) array, so you can do anything with it, primarily like create a twitter thread in one go using twitter API for twitter bots. You can also create a twitter thread in response to somebody else's tweet (which might come from example listening to twitter's stream API for a particular keyword (hashtag, twitter tags, etc))

## Install

`npm install --save create-twitter-thread`

or

`yarn add create-twitter-thread`

## Test

`yarn/npm test`

---

```javascript
const thread = createTwitterThreadMessages(
  messageString,
  twitterHandleObject[optional],
);
```

#### messageString

Type: `string`

String that needs to be broken down into <= 280 length tweets and assimilated in an array.

#### twitterHandleObject[optional]

// if you want to tag a particular person, you've to do it in the message
// in the first option above itself
{

    own: '@yourTwitterHandle';
  }
}

// if you want to reply to someone's tweet with a thread
// you got to keep tagging them to make a thread, the following
// takes care of it (also see sample example below)

{
  threadTo: {
    other: '@otherPersonHandle';
  }
}
```

God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I have a dark side, too. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

I have a dark side, too. You lookâ€¦perfect. God created pudding, and then he rested. Tell him time is of the essence. You all right, Dexter?

I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.
You lookâ€¦perfect.
Watching ice melt. This is fun. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm generally confused most of the time.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Hello, Dexter Morgan. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I have a dark side, too.
