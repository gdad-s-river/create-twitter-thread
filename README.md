# create-twitter-thread

Put in a long string (a long tweet with > 280 characters) and it will break it down for you in multiple chunks (each individual tweet < 280 characters) array, so you can do anything with it, primarily create a twitter thread in one go using twitter API ([like twitter's native tweet thread functionality](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-twitter/issues/120))

## Install

`npm install --save create-twitter-thread` (not published yet)

## Test

`npm test`

---

## API

### const tweetsArray = createTwitterThreadMessages(messageString, navMessage[optional][default: "ðŸ‘‡"])

#### message

Type: `string`

String that needs to be broken down into <280 length messages and assimilated in an array.

#### navMessage

An optional navigation string (message) that you might need at the end of tweets (to show that there are more tweets in the tweet thread).

Type: `string`, default: 'ðŸ‘‡'

#### tweetsArray

Type: `array of strings`

---

God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I have a dark side, too. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.

I have a dark side, too. You lookâ€¦perfect. God created pudding, and then he rested. Tell him time is of the essence. You all right, Dexter?

He taught me a code. To survive.
I am not a killer. Like a sloth. I can do that. I like seafood. Only you could make those words cute.

This man is a knight in shining armor.
Watching ice melt. This is fun.
I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.
You lookâ€¦perfect.
Watching ice melt. This is fun. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm generally confused most of the time.

Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. He taught me a code. To survive. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo.

I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Cops, another community I'm not part of.

Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Hello, Dexter Morgan. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I have a dark side, too.

I am not a killer. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I'm generally confused most of the time. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

I have a dark side, too. Keep your mind limber. I'm partial to air conditioning. This man is a knight in shining armor. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm really more an apartment person.

Watching ice melt. This is fun. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex!

Tell him time is of the essence. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client.

I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I like seafood. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am. Watching ice melt. This is fun.

Only you could make those words cute. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I'm really more an apartment person.

I'm generally confused most of the time. He taught me a code. To survive. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask â€¦ not just me. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.
